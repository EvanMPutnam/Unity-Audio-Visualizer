# Unity-Audio-Visualizer
Unity Audio Visualizer which works with the default microphone of a device.


TODO:
1: Include an interface to change settings from outside of unity editor.
2: More visualizations??? Maybe...


Has 4 components in the unity Assets folder.

1: Main scene in which to run.
2: Shader for blocks
3: Blocks
4: AudioViz Script

The application works by getting sample data from the audio and then adjusting height of colored blocks to get an audio
visualization.


You can of course change the sample size and everything to alter the visualization to your own needs in the unity editor.
